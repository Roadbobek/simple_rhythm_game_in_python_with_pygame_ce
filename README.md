# Simple Rhythm Game In Python with Pygame CE
### A simple rhythm game made with Python utilising PyGame CE.

I have zero experience with Pygame, so I am going to experiment for a bit.
Later on I want to remake the same simple game with Pyglet and RayLib.
And eventually in C++ using RayLib, though I am still learning C++.
